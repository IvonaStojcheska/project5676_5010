This project manages a bookstore. It keeps data about the books, the authors and the publishers. 
Each of them have few methods that are crucial for a functioning bookstore. The methods are stored in the controller.
The first method is list() . This method takes the data from the database and prints it. If we want to print a certain data entry(a certain book, author or publisher), 
we have a method for that as well. We just need to send the book_id(author_id, publisher_id) as a parametar in the get method.
The other methods that we implemented are for creating new data, updating the data or deleting the data. Theese all can be tested in Postman, choosing the appropriate method.
